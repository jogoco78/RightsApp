    <string name="about_us_body">The <b>RightsApp</b> app is the main outcome for the DG-Justice funded project “Mobile Technologies applied to protect victims of a crime within the EU Area of Justice: RightsApp for e-Justice” (<a href="http://rightsapp-project.eu" target="blank">http://rightsapp-project.eu</a>), which has received funding from the DG-Justice European Union’s Programme (2014-2020) under Grant Agreement No. 785854.
        \n\nThe Consortium is mainly composed of two non-profit organizations within the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB): the UAB Institute of Law and Technology (IDT-UAB, <a href="http://idt.uab.cat" target="blank">http://idt.uab.cat</a>) and the UAB International Welcome Point (IWP-UAB, <a href="https://www.uab.cat/international-welcome-point/" target="blank">https://www.uab.cat/international-welcome-point/</a>).
        \n\nThe <b>UAB Institute of Law and Technology (IDT-UAB)</b> is a research centre promoting cutting-edge research on law and technology from an interdisciplinary perspective. Its core mission is that of fostering research devoted to providing legal professionals, institutions, organizations, and citizens with appropriate technologies to enhance their legal work or to improve the exercise of their rights. Appropriate technologies in this context imply that research is user oriented, so that both the technological design and its developments are tailored to the needs of the end users and not the opposite.
        \n\nThe <b>UAB International Welcome Point (IWP-UAB)</b> is an office designed by the International Relationships Office to provide services to all foreigner members of the UAB community. Thus, giving support for the students, lecturers, administrative staff and services staff from other countries. It provides practical information like legal procedures for EU and non-EU citizens, health cover for EU citizens, budget for living in Barcelona and useful addresses. Moreover, the IWP provides support on foreigners stay and work permit renewal applications, coordinates assistance among UAB offices and assistance to international postgraduate grant holders.
        \n\nMoreover, the <b>UAB Faculty of Law </b>(FoL, <a href="https://www.uab.cat/dret/">https://www.uab.cat/dret/</a>), <b>LAST-JD Erasmus Mundus</b> (LAST-JD) and the <b>Catalan Society of Victimology</b> (CSV, <a href="https://www.victimologia.cat/">https://www.victimologia.cat/</a>)  also contribute to qualitative and quantitative research and dissemination as well. The UAB Faculty of Law every year receives more than 60 students from other countries to study abroad in its student mobility programs (Erasmus Programme) and every year about 2.600 individuals enrol at its degrees and post degree courses. The Catalan Society of Victimology groups together lawyers, psychologists, doctors, social workers, among others. </string>
